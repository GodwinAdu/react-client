                  As followers and children of God, we were promised ‘the
                  helper’ by our saviour Jesus Christ before he went to heaven.
                  The holy spirit came as was promised and we believe in Him as
                  God, occupying out bodies which we have set apart as holy
                  temples for Him. We rely on him to reveal all truths to us, to
                  be our strength and the one who orders our daily steps. We
                  believe that for by strength shall no man prevail. And Except
                  the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.
